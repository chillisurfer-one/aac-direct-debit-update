## Detailed Policy Evaluations

### Non-Compliant Policies

#### ARC-POLICY-103 - ❌ NON-COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: No

Deviations:
- 1: The UML diagram shows a relationship where the `MandateUpdateService` container connects directly to the `ThoughtMachine` external system. This violates the policy rule that only the `VaultCoreClient` adapter is allowed to connect to the `ThoughtMachine` external system. According to the policy logic, any container other than `VaultCoreClient` connecting to `ThoughtMachine` is non-compliant.

Suggestions:
- 1: Modify the architecture so that the `MandateUpdateService` does not directly connect to `ThoughtMachine`. Instead, ensure that all interactions with `ThoughtMachine` are routed through the `VaultCoreClient`. This can be achieved by having the `MandateUpdateService` call the `VaultCoreClient`, which then handles the connection to `ThoughtMachine`. Update the UML diagram to reflect this change, ensuring that the relationship between `MandateUpdateService` and `ThoughtMachine` is removed and replaced with a relationship between `MandateUpdateService` and `VaultCoreClient`.

### Compliant Policies

#### ARC-POLICY-101 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

Conclusion: The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. All microservices (WebAPI, ServiceLayer, VaultCoreClient) are defined within a system boundary labeled 'ECS', which adheres to the policy requirement that containers must be deployed in ECS Fargate.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-102 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

Conclusion:
The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. The relationships defined in the diagram ensure that external systems, such as "ClientApp," only connect directly to the "ApiGateway," which is a valid API Gateway alias according to the policy. There are no direct connections from external systems to non-API-Gateway components, thus adhering to the policy requirements.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-104 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. The container "VaultCoreClient" makes an external call to "ThoughtMachine" and is correctly annotated with the stereotype "uses_secret," which satisfies the policy requirement that containers making external calls must be marked as using secrets. Therefore, there are no deviations from the policy.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-105 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

Conclusion: The UML diagram includes an "Audit Log" data store using "Amazon RDS PostgreSQL," which satisfies the policy requirement for a persistent data store related to audit or logging. Therefore, the architecture complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-105.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-106 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram includes a container named "AWS Secrets Manager" with the stereotype "secrets_store," which satisfies the policy requirement that at least one container must have 'secrets' in the name or be labeled <<secrets_store>>. Therefore, the architecture complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-106.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-108 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-108. The policy requires at least one container to be labeled as <<observability>> or include 'cloudwatch' in the name. The UML diagram includes the "Amazon CloudWatch" container, which is labeled with the stereotype <<observability>>. Therefore, the architecture meets the observability component requirement specified in the policy.
