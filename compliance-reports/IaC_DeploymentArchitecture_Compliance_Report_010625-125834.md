## Non-Compliant Modules and Remediation Steps

### observability-module

| Category                                              | Details                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Components Present in PUML Diagram and Terraform Code    | CloudWatch                                                     |
| Components Present in PUML Diagram Not in Terraform Code | None                                                           |
| Components Present in Terraform Code Not in PUML Diagram | aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm, aws_cloudwatch_log_group          |
| Connection Discrepancies                                 | MandateUpdateService -> CloudWatch and VaultCoreClient -> CloudWatch connections are not explicitly defined in Terraform code. |
| Label/Annotation Discrepancies                           | None                                                           |

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **[Connection Implementation]:**
   - Ensure that the connections from MandateUpdateService and VaultCoreClient to CloudWatch are explicitly defined in the Terraform code. This could involve setting up appropriate IAM roles and policies to allow logging and metrics from these services to CloudWatch.

2. **[Resource Alignment]:**
   - Align the Terraform resources with the architecture diagram by ensuring that the aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm and aws_cloudwatch_log_group are represented in the diagram if they are part of the observability module's scope.

### rds-secrets-module

| Category                                              | Details                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Components Present in PUML Diagram and Terraform Code    | Secrets Manager, Audit Log (Amazon RDS PostgreSQL)              |
| Components Present in PUML Diagram Not in Terraform Code | None                                                            |
| Components Present in Terraform Code Not in PUML Diagram | aws_db_subnet_group.this                                        |
| Connection Discrepancies                                 | MandateUpdateController -> Secrets Manager connection not explicitly defined in Terraform code. |
| Label/Annotation Discrepancies                           | None                                                            |

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **Connection Definition:**
   - Ensure IAM roles and policies are defined to allow MandateUpdateController to read secrets from Secrets Manager.
   - Verify that the MandateUpdateService has the necessary permissions and configurations to write to the Audit Log (Amazon RDS PostgreSQL).

2. **Documentation and Code Alignment:**
   - Update Terraform code to include IAM roles and policies that reflect the connection from MandateUpdateController to Secrets Manager.
   - Ensure that the Terraform code includes any necessary configurations for the MandateUpdateService to interact with the Audit Log database.

### security-module

| Category                                              | Details                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Components Present in PUML Diagram and Terraform Code    | None                                                            |
| Components Present in PUML Diagram Not in Terraform Code | Amazon API Gateway                                              |
| Components Present in Terraform Code Not in PUML Diagram | aws_security_group.ecs, aws_security_group.alb, aws_security_group.rds |
| Connection Discrepancies                                 | Amazon API Gateway -> MandateUpdateController (Spring Boot): HTTPS Route not implemented in Terraform code |
| Label/Annotation Discrepancies                           | None                                                            |

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **Add Amazon API Gateway Resource:**
   - Define an `aws_api_gateway_rest_api` resource in the Terraform code to represent the Amazon API Gateway component.
   - Ensure the API Gateway is configured to route requests to the MandateUpdateController (Spring Boot) component.

2. **Implement Connection for API Gateway:**
   - Establish the connection between the Amazon API Gateway and MandateUpdateController using appropriate Terraform resources such as `aws_api_gateway_integration`.
   - Ensure the integration type and method match the HTTPS Route specified in the diagram.

3. **Review Security Group Usage:**
   - Verify if the security groups defined in Terraform are necessary for the "security-module" or if they should be part of another module.
   - Adjust the module boundaries or definitions accordingly to ensure alignment with the architecture diagram.
