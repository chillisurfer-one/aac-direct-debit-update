## Detailed Policy Evaluations

### Non-Compliant Policies

#### ARC-POLICY-103 - ❌ NON-COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: No

Deviations:
- 1: The UML diagram indicates that the `MandateUpdateService` container has a relationship with the `ThoughtMachine` external system. This violates the policy, which explicitly states that only the `VaultCoreClient` adapter is allowed to connect to the `ThoughtMachine` external system. The policy logic checks that the source of any relationship to `ThoughtMachine` must be `VaultCoreClient`, and the presence of `MandateUpdateService` as a source in the input JSON triggers a policy violation.

Suggestions:
- 1: To fix this deviation, ensure that the `MandateUpdateService` does not directly connect to the `ThoughtMachine` external system. Instead, route all interactions with `ThoughtMachine` through the `VaultCoreClient` adapter. This can be achieved by modifying the architecture so that `MandateUpdateService` communicates with `VaultCoreClient`, which then handles the connection to `ThoughtMachine`. Update the UML diagram to reflect this change by removing the direct relationship between `MandateUpdateService` and `ThoughtMachine` and adding a relationship between `MandateUpdateService` and `VaultCoreClient` for mandate update operations.

### Compliant Policies

#### ARC-POLICY-101 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. All microservices (WebAPI, ServiceLayer, VaultCoreClient) are defined within a system boundary labeled "ECS," which satisfies the policy requirement that containers must be deployed in ECS Fargate. Therefore, there are no deviations from the policy, and no suggestions for changes are necessary.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-102 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. The policy checks that external systems do not connect directly to non-API-Gateway components. The relationships in the UML diagram show that the external system "ClientApp" connects to "ApiGateway," which is a valid API Gateway alias according to the policy. Therefore, there are no deviations from the policy requirements.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-104 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. The `VaultCoreClient` container, which makes an external call to `ThoughtMachine`, is correctly annotated with the stereotype `<<uses_secret>>`, satisfying the policy requirement that containers making external calls must be marked as using secrets. Therefore, there are no deviations from the policy, and no suggestions for fixes are necessary.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-105 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the policy because it includes an "Audit Log" data store, which is implemented using "Amazon RDS PostgreSQL." This satisfies the policy requirement for a data store related to audit or logging, as the policy specifically checks for the presence of a data store with "audit" or "log" in its name and using technologies like "PostgreSQL" or "RDS." The provided input JSON confirms that the "Audit Log" container meets these criteria, resulting in no policy violations.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-106 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-106. The policy requires that at least one container must have 'secrets' in the name or be labeled <<secrets_store>>. The UML diagram includes a container named "AWS Secrets Manager" with the stereotype <<secrets_store>>, which satisfies the policy requirement. Therefore, there are no deviations, and the architecture is compliant.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-108 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-108. The policy requires at least one container to be labeled as <<observability>> or include 'cloudwatch' in the name. The diagram includes the "Amazon CloudWatch" container, which is labeled with the stereotype <<observability>>, fulfilling the policy requirement. Therefore, there are no deviations, and no suggestions for changes are necessary.
