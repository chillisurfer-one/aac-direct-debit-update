## Detailed Policy Evaluations

### Non-Compliant Policies

#### ARC-POLICY-102 - ❌ NON-COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: No

Deviations:
- 1: The UML diagram shows a relationship from `ThoughtMachine` (an external system) directly to `AdapterClient`. This violates the policy because the policy specifies that external systems must not connect directly to non-API-Gateway components. The policy expects all external interactions to go through an API Gateway.

Suggestions:
- 1: To fix this deviation, ensure that any interaction from `ThoughtMachine` to internal services is routed through an API Gateway. You could introduce an API Gateway component between `ThoughtMachine` and `AdapterClient` to mediate this interaction. Alternatively, if `ThoughtMachine` is not intended to directly initiate requests, ensure that the diagram accurately reflects the intended architecture where `ThoughtMachine` is only accessed through internal services that are behind an API Gateway.

Conclusion: The architecture does not comply with the policy due to the direct connection from an external system to a non-API-Gateway component. Adjustments are needed to ensure compliance.

#### ARC-POLICY-103 - ❌ NON-COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: No

Deviations:
- 1: The UML diagram shows a relationship where the "MandateUpdateService" container directly accesses the "ThoughtMachine" external system. This violates the policy rule which states that only the "VaultCoreClient" adapter is allowed to connect to the "ThoughtMachine" external system. The policy logic explicitly checks for any source other than "VaultCoreClient" attempting to connect to "ThoughtMachine" and flags it as non-compliant.

Suggestions:
- 1: To fix this deviation, modify the architecture so that the "MandateUpdateService" does not directly connect to "ThoughtMachine". Instead, ensure that all interactions with "ThoughtMachine" are routed through the "VaultCoreClient" adapter. This can be achieved by having the "MandateUpdateService" call the "VaultCoreClient" for any operations that require interaction with "ThoughtMachine". This change will align the architecture with the policy requirements, ensuring compliance.

### Compliant Policies

#### ARC-POLICY-101 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. All microservices ("WebAPI", "ServiceLayer", and "VaultCoreClient") are defined within a system boundary labeled "ecs", which satisfies the policy requirement that containers must be deployed in ECS Fargate. The expected policy output JSON is empty, indicating no violations, which matches the evaluation of the UML diagram.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-104 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. The `VaultCoreClient` container, which makes external calls to the `ThoughtMachine` system, is correctly annotated with the stereotype `<<uses_secret>>`, satisfying the policy requirement that containers making external calls must be marked as using secrets.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-105 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. The policy requires the architecture to include an audit log or persistent data store related to audit or logging, and the UML diagram includes an "Audit Log" component using "Amazon RDS PostgreSQL," which satisfies the policy's requirements. The expected policy output is an empty array, indicating no violations, which matches the provided expected policy output JSON.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-106 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram adheres to the provided OPA policy. The policy requires that at least one container must have 'secrets' in the name or be labeled with the stereotype <<secrets_store>>. The UML diagram includes a container named "AWS Secrets Manager" with the stereotype <<secrets_store>>, which satisfies the policy requirement. Therefore, there are no deviations, and the architecture is compliant.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-108 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. The policy requires that at least one container must be labeled as <<observability>> or include 'cloudwatch' in the name. The "Amazon CloudWatch" container in the diagram is labeled with the stereotype <<observability>>, satisfying the policy requirement. Therefore, there are no deviations, and the architecture is compliant.
