## Detailed Policy Evaluations

### Non-Compliant Policies

#### ARC-POLICY-103 - ❌ NON-COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: No

Deviations:
- 1: The UML diagram shows a relationship where the `MandateUpdateService` connects directly to the `ThoughtMachine` external system. This violates the policy which states that only the `VaultCoreClient` adapter is allowed to connect to the `ThoughtMachine` external system.

Suggestions:
- 1: Modify the architecture so that the `MandateUpdateService` does not directly connect to the `ThoughtMachine`. Instead, ensure that all interactions with the `ThoughtMachine` are routed through the `VaultCoreClient`. This could involve refactoring the `MandateUpdateService` to delegate any necessary calls to the `VaultCoreClient`, which would then handle the communication with `ThoughtMachine`.

### Compliant Policies

#### ARC-POLICY-101 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. All microservices (WebAPI, ServiceLayer, VaultCoreClient) are defined within a system boundary labeled "ecs," which aligns with the policy requirement that containers must be deployed in ECS Fargate. Therefore, there are no deviations from the policy, and no suggestions for changes are necessary.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-102 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

Conclusion: The UML diagram adheres to the provided OPA policy. The relationships specified in the policy input JSON match those in the UML diagram, and there are no direct connections from external systems to non-API-Gateway components. The external system "ClientApp" connects directly to "ApiGateway," which is compliant with the policy.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-104 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. The `VaultCoreClient` container, which makes an external call to the `ThoughtMachine` system, is correctly annotated with the `<<uses_secret>>` stereotype. This satisfies the policy requirement that any container making external calls must be marked as using secrets. Therefore, there are no deviations from the policy.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-105 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram includes an "Audit Log" data store using "Amazon RDS PostgreSQL," which satisfies the policy requirement for a data store related to audit or logging. The policy checks for the presence of a container with a name containing "audit" or "log" and using technology such as "PostgreSQL" or "RDS," or having a stereotype of "data_store." The provided input JSON confirms the presence of such a container, and therefore, the architecture complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-105.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-106 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram includes a container named "AWS Secrets Manager" with the stereotype "secrets_store," which satisfies the policy requirement for a secrets management component. Therefore, the architecture complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-106.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-108 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-108. The policy requires at least one container to be labeled as <<observability>> or include 'cloudwatch' in the name. The UML diagram includes the "Amazon CloudWatch" container, which is labeled with the stereotype <<observability>>. Therefore, the architecture meets the observability component requirement specified in the policy.
